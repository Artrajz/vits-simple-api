# Deployment

There are two deployment options to choose from. Regardless of the option you select, you'll need to import the model after deployment to use the application.

## Docker Deployment (Recommended for Linux)

### Step 1: Pull the Docker Image

Run the following command to pull the Docker image. Follow the prompts in the script to choose the necessary files to download and pull the image:

```bash
bash -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Artrajz/vits-simple-api/main/vits-simple-api-installer-latest.sh)"
```

The default paths for project configuration files and model folders are `/usr/local/vits-simple-api/`.

### Step 2: Start

Run the following command to start the container:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Image Update

To update the image, run the following commands:

```bash
docker-compose pull
```

Then, restart the container:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Virtual Environment Deployment

### Step 1: Clone the Project

Clone the project repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Artrajz/vits-simple-api.git
```

### Step 2: Install Python Dependencies

It is recommended to use a virtual environment with Python version 3.10 for this project. Run the following command to install the Python dependencies required for the project:

If you encounter issues installing certain dependencies, please refer to the common problems outlined below.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Start

Run the following command to start the program:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Windows Quick Deployment Package

### Step 1: Download and Extract the Deployment Package

Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/Artrajz/vits-simple-api/releases) and download the latest deployment package. Extract the downloaded files.

For compression reasons (and the Github release limiting the size of a single file to 2GB), there are some optional dependency models that are not included in the deployment package, and these are usually downloaded **automatically** by the program when loading the corresponding sound model (if the loaded model requires it). 

In case the program doesn't download the dependency model manually, or if you find that If the program does not download the sound model automatically and you need to download the dependency model manually, or if you find that the successfully loaded sound model is empty, please read the **Troubleshooting - Successfully loaded model is empty** section below.

### Step 2: Start

Run `start.bat` to launch the program.

## Model Loading

### Step 1: Download VITS Models
Download the VITS model files and place them in the `data/models` folder.

### Step 2: Loading Models

#### Automatic Model Loading

Starting from version 0.6.6, it is default behavior to automatically load all models in the `data/models` folder, making it easier for beginners to use.

(If this is your first time and you don't have any additional special needs, you don't need to know how to load the model manually)

#### Manual Model Loading

After the initial startup, a config.yaml configuration file will be generated. You need to change `tts_config.auto_load` to `false` in order to enable manual loading mode.

You can modify the `tts_model_config.tts_modes` in the config.yaml or make modifications in the admin panel in the browser.

**Note: After version 0.6.6, the model loading path has been modified. Please follow the steps below to configure the model path again!**

The path can be an absolute path or a relative path. If it's a relative path, it starts from the `data/models` folder in the project root directory.

For example, if the `data/models` folder has the following files:

```
├─model1
│  │─G_1000.pth
│  └─config.json
└─model2
   │─G_1000.pth
   └─config.json
```

Fill in the configuration like this in the YAML file:

```yaml
tts_config:
  auto_load: false
  models:
  - config_path: model1/config.json
    vits_path: model1/G_1000.pth
  - config_path: model2/config.json
    vits_path: model2/G_1000.pth
	# GPT-SoVITS
  - vits_path: gpt_sovits1/model1_e8_s11536.pth
    t2s_path: gpt_sovits1/model1-e15.ckpt
  - vits_path: gpt_sovits2/model2_e8_s11536.pth
    t2s_path: gpt_sovits2/model2-e15.ckpt
```

Loading models through the admin panel is convenient, but if you want to load models outside the `data/models` folder, you can only do so by modifying the config.yaml configuration file. The method is to directly provide the absolute path.

Absolute path example:

```yaml
tts_config:
  auto_load: false
  models:
  - config_path: D://model3/config.json
    vits_path: D://model3/G_1000.pth
```

- models_path: This is the models folder relative to the data directory, with the default value being "models". When auto_load is set to true, all models in the models_path directory will be loaded.

#### Other Models

After downloading the BERT model and emotion model, place them in the `data/bert` and `data/emotional` folders respectively. Find the corresponding names and insert them accordingly.

# GPU accelerated

## Windows
### Install CUDA
Check the highest version of CUDA supported by your graphics card:
```
nvidia-smi
```
Taking CUDA 11.7 as an example, download it from the [official website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-7-0-download-archive?target_os=Windows&amp;target_arch=x86_64&amp;target_version=10&amp;target_type=exe_local)
### Install GPU version of PyTorch

https://pytorch.org/

```
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```
## Linux
The installation process is similar, but I don't have the environment to test it.

# WebUI

## Inference Frontend

 http://127.0.0.1:23456

*Port is modifiable under the default setting of port 23456.

## Admin Backend

The default address is http://127.0.0.1:23456/admin.

**The initial username and password can be found by searching for 'admin' in the config.yaml file after the first startup.**

# Function Options Explanation

## Disable the Admin Backend

The admin backend allows loading and unloading models, and while it has login authentication, for added security, you can disable the admin backend in the `config.yaml`:

```yaml
'IS_ADMIN_ENABLED': !!bool 'false'
```

This extra measure helps ensure absolute security when making the admin backend inaccessible to the public network.

## Bert-VITS2 Configuration and Language/Bert Model Usage

Starting from Bert-VITS2 v2.0, a model requires loading three different language Bert models. If you only need to use one or two languages, you can add the `lang` parameter in the `config.json` file of the model's data section. The value `["zh"]` indicates that the model only uses Chinese and will load Chinese Bert models. The value `["zh", "ja"]` indicates the usage of both Chinese and Japanese bilingual models, and only Chinese and Japanese Bert models will be loaded. Similarly, this pattern continues for other language combinations.

Example:

```json
"data": {
  "lang": ["zh", "ja"],
  "training_files": "filelists/train.list",
  "validation_files": "filelists/val.list",
  "max_wav_value": 32768.0,
  ...
```
## Custom Chinese Polyphonic Dictionary

If you encounter issues with incorrect pronunciation of polyphonic characters, you can try resolving it using the following method.

Create and open phrases_dict.txt in the `data` directory to add polyphonic words.

```python
{
"一骑当千": [["yí"], ["jì"], ["dāng"], ["qiān"]],
}
```

## GPT-SoVITS Reference Audio Presets

Find the configuration for GPT-SoVITS in the config.yaml file. Add presets under the presets section. Multiple presets can be added, with keys serving as preset names. Below are two default presets, default and default2:

```
gpt_sovits_config:
  hz: 50
  is_half: false
  id: 0
  lang: auto
  format: wav
  segment_size: 50
  presets:
    default:
      refer_wav_path: null
      prompt_text: null
      prompt_lang: auto
    default2:
      refer_wav_path: null
      prompt_text: null
      prompt_lang: auto
```

## Reading API

Tested in [legado](https://github.com/gedoor/legado)

Multiple models can be used for reading, including VITS, Bert-VITS2, GPT-SoVITS. Parameters starting with `in` configure the speaker of the text in quotes, while parameters starting with `nr` configure the narrator.

To use GPT-SoVITS, it is necessary to configure the reference audio in the `presets` section of the `config.yaml` file in advance and modify the preset in the URL below.

The IP in the URL can be found after the API is started, generally using a local area network IP starting with 192.168.

After modification, select the reading engine, add the reading engine, paste the source, and enable the reading engine.

```js
{
  "concurrentRate": "1",
  "contentType": "audio/wav",
  "enabledCookieJar": false,
  "header": "",
  "id": 1709643305070,
  "lastUpdateTime": 1709821070082,
  "loginCheckJs": "",
  "loginUi": "",
  "loginUrl": "",
  "name": "vits-simple-api",
  "url": "http://192.168.xxx.xxx:23456/voice/reading?text={{java.encodeURI(speakText)}}&in_model_type=GPT-SOVITS&in_id=0&in_preset=default&nr_model_type=BERT-VITS2&nr_id=0&nr_preset=default&format=wav&lang=zh"
}
```



# Frequently Asked Questions

## Bert-VITS2 Version Compatibility

To ensure compatibility with the Bert-VITS2 model, modify the config.json file by adding a version parameter "version": "x.x.x". For instance, if the model version is 1.0.1, the configuration file should be written as:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.1",
  "train": {
    "log_interval": 10,
    "eval_interval": 100,
    "seed": 52,
    ...
```

Please note that for the Chinese extra version, the version should be changed to `extra` or `zh-clap`, and for the extra fix version, the version should be `2.4` or `extra-fix`.

## Troubleshooting - Successfully loaded models are empty 
First of all, please check if your program directory is a **plain English path** (can't contain any Chinese or special characters), or else you will encounter the situation that the program can't load models even if it doesn't report an error. 

Secondly, please check if your models are correctly placed (refer to the section of **Manual Model Loading**). 

Your models should not be placed directly in `data/models`, but in a folder under the models directory (this folder can be any name without special characters), one directory for each sound model. 

Lastly, check the log for any messages like download failure, you can refer to the following section on **manually placing dependent models**
